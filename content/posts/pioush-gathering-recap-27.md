# 🚀 Pioush Meetup #27 Recap  

The first **Pioush** meetup of 1404 was a great start to the new year! We kicked off with discussions on **Frontend Technologies**, where participants shared their experiences, challenges, and insights.  

## 🔍 Key Discussions  

### Exploring Hugo  
When **Omid** joined and expressed his interest in learning **Hugo**, we decided to explore it together. **Hugo** is a powerful **Static Site Generator** (SSG) that helps developers build fast and lightweight websites.  

### Transportation & IoT  
Beyond technical topics, we also had engaging discussions on:  
- 🚌 **Public transportation and bus routing in Shiraz**  
- 🌐 **IoT (Internet of Things) and its applications**  

## 💻 Hands-on Hugo Workshop  
All participants who brought their laptops installed **Hugo** and successfully built their first simple websites. It was an exciting and practical session that helped everyone get familiar with the basics of Hugo.  

## 🔄 Continuing Topics in Future Meetups  
One key takeaway from this session was the idea of **continuing topics across multiple meetups**. Instead of covering a subject in just one session, we decided to go deeper and explore **Hugo** further in the upcoming meetups.  

## 🚀 Plans for Pioush #28  
For the next session, each participant can:  
✅ Build their **personal website** using **Hugo and GitHub Pages**.  
✅ Work on any other project they have in mind using Hugo.  

📅 **Looking forward to seeing you at Pioush #28!**
